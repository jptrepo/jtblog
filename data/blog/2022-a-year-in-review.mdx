# Introduction

Looking at the last time I touched this blog project, it was on 12-29-2022. I had these grand ideas of becoming a blogger in the cloud, low-code, and higher ed space to facilitate my own never-ending learning and tinkering journey.
It definitely wasn't AI that held my finger back from actually releasing and publicisizng. Just self doubt. Who was going to read this and why did it matter? I forgot my original intentions somewhere around then. Somewhere around the
start of the year, professional development ceded to ego > fear > doubt > cyncism > work life > excuses > and so on.

# Well I am back

But now what? Why am I doing this? Maybe to document these next five years and serve as a marker to come back to.

# Rerunning the past

# Always learning
